# Project 4: Convolutional Neural Networks

The primary goal of this project is to design and train a deep learning model with the ability to accurately identify the species of a plant by analyzing the visual characteristics present in an image of its sprout or seedling. By leveraging advanced image analysis techniques and utilizing a dataset consisting of labeled plant images, the model aims to learn distinctive patterns and features specific to each plant species. Ultimately, the trained model will provide an automated and efficient means of species classification, which can have significant applications in areas such as agriculture, botany, and ecological research.

The dataset is aim to answer the following questions:
1. How much would the model testing be affected by image noise e.g. the edges of a planter, windowsills, etc., in the training set?
2. How does the model react to plant types that are not in the training dataset?
3. How does the model react to plants that are not in ideal condition, e.g. discolored, dried, etc.?
4. Does the dataset include the growth stage as a variable? 
5. How is the model affected when the sample image shows the plant in different stages? 
6. Is it possible to predict the growth stage of the plants based on an image? 
7. Would this be useful to determine ideal harvesting times for the plant?
8. Can the model determine the health of the plant?
9. Can the model (be trained to) determine weeds vs planned plantings?
